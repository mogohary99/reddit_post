            "It's a subjective. I think stock topre is fine, but modded with after market domes and lubed, it's a thing of beauty. There are tons of other switch types out there that are fantastic such as Alps, buckling springs, and various contactless switch types such as hall effect and optoelectrical switches. All these in my opinion tend to have superior clickyness, tactility or smoothness in their respective categories. I still like a good cherry clone, it's just nice to feel some variety. It's like test driving a million different automatic transmission 150hp sedans your whole life and thinking that's variety, and then one day, you try a manual transmission coupe with 350hp or a lifted vintage Ford Bronco or a rally hot hatch, then a primo super car, then a Harley Davidson, etc, etc. That's variety.",

            "Agreed! Maybe we can get more variety in PCB types for different boards. I’d buy one. Wuque isn’t even offering solder pcbs with their Zoom 98 so I doubt they’ll offer something unique like topre either, though I would definitely buy a second pcb/internals to be able to switch between them and try it out! Higher end boards definitely should have this option imo, since budget zoom boards definitel won’t.",
